🟩 Post-conditions (Output Guarantees)
Postcondition = function chal kar complete ho gaya, to kya guarantee return karta hai.
➡️ Matlab output ke rules.
➡️ Call ke baad kya-kya true hona chahiye.

👉 Child class should not weaken postconditions.
Parent jo output guarantee deta hai, child ko bhi wahi guarantee maintain karni hogi (ya better).

❌ Bad (violates LSP)
Parent:
withdraw(amount)
Guarantee: balance will reduce EXACT amount.

Child:
withdraw(amount)
Balance reduce karta hai amount + extra fee

➡️ Parent ki guarantee break ho gayi.
Client code expects exact deduction, child surprise behavior deta hai → LSP break.

✔ Good
Child can keep postconditions same or stronger, but never weaker.

Example stronger (allowed):
Parent: returns ≥ 0
Child: returns ≥ 10 (this is stronger guarantee → fine)
